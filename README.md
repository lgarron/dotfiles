# Lucas Garron's `dotfiles`

My own personal configuration files and scripts for various commandline-based tools and apps. Also serves as the `lgarron/lgarron` [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) tap.

Linked [using GNU `stow`](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html) (for now).
